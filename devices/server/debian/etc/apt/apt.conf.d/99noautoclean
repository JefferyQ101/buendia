# Configure apt to keep cached .deb files indefinitely instead of deleting
# them when they get old, so that we can include all the necessary .deb files
# when making backups of the system.  We still want to avoid running out of
# disk space, though, so we set a size limit on the cache.  The limit can be
# modest because we'll delete the .deb files for the base installation and
#  and only keep .deb files for packages added after the base installation.
