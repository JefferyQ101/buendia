# Files in this directory list hostnames by which this machine wants to be
# known.  Each file should contain hostnames in a list, one per line.
# Blank lines and comments (everything after "#" on a line) are ignored.
# When NETWORKING_DHCP_DNS_SERVER is 1, this machine will be a DNS server
# that resolves all of these names to its own IP.
